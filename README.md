## Overview

This repository presents a hardware-accelerated implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm designed specifically for FPGA platforms, using Verilog and High-Level Synthesis (HLS) on the Xilinx Arty Z7-20 (part: xc7z014sclg400-1). The project targets real-time, low-latency machine learning inference on embedded systems and can serve as a valuable reference for researchers, students, and engineers interested in hardware-based ML acceleration. The design includes all necessary source files, testbenches, and build scripts, making it easy to simulate, synthesize, and deploy.
